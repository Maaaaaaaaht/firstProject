      For my hobby project, i wanted to talk about my passion for plants,
      whether they are in their natural habitat or artificially grown indoor. Since i'm a kid, i've always enjoyed beeing outside and climbing on trees. Just being surrounded by nature. Later as a teenager i started collectioning some plants and multiply them.    
      I always like observing them growing as well as spending time taking care of them. This passion hasn't left me and i still looked after plants wherever i lived. Whether i lived in a diffent country, a big or a small city, warm or cold climate i've always managed to be around plants.

        <img src="imagePlant1.jpeg" alt="Philodendron Melanochrysum" />
        <h3 class="container">Philodendron Melanochrysum</h3>
        <p>
          I love the shape the shape of the leaves, it can climb up to the
          ceiling. I had a one for a year but sadly died due to spider mites...
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="plantCard">
        <img src="imagePlant2.jpeg" alt="Florida Ghost philodendron" />
        <h3 class="container">Florida ghost Philodendron</h3>
        <p>
          This Philodendron produces a beautiful yellow leaf every 2 months, it
          then slowly turns green as it's getting full of Chlorophyle.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="plantCard">
        <img src="imagePlant3.jpeg" alt="Philodendron Gloriosum" />
        <h3 class="container">Philodendron Gloriosum</h3>
        <p>
          Those Philodendron leaves offer a perfect ground cover, i'd love to
          have them to in my dream conservatory.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="plantCard">
        <img src="imagePlant4.jpeg" alt="Alocasia Macrorrhiza Variegata" />
        <h3 class="container">Alocasia Macrorrhiza Variegata</h3>
        <p>
          Here is my dream plant, i really wish i could own one of this. They
          can grown up to 15feet, not really appropriate for a London flat...
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="plantCard">
        <img src="imagePlant5.jpeg" alt="Ficus lyrata" />
        <h3 class="container">Ficus lyrata</h3>
        <p>
          This is the biggest plant i own, it is about 2 feet tall and doesnt
          stop growing although i have to fight hard against bugs that loves
          feeding on it.
        </p>

      <div class="plantCard">
        <img src="imagePlant6.jpeg" alt="Philodendron ring of ire" />
        <h3 class="container">Philodendron ring of fire</h3>
        <p>
          This is my favourite plant, it produces a vivid orange new leave every
          month. I've been given one from a friend, it was in a very poor state
          and after a year it came back from the dead and looks amazing now.
